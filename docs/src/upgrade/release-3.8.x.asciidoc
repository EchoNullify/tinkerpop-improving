*NOT OFFICIALLY NAMED YET*

== TinkerPop 3.8.0

*Release Date: NOT OFFICIALLY RELEASED YET*

Please see the link:https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/3.8.0/CHANGELOG.asciidoc#release-3-8-0[changelog] for a
complete list of all the modifications that are part of this release.

=== Upgrading for Users

==== Simplification to g creation
The creation of "g" is the start point to writing Gremlin. There are a number of ways to create it, but TinkerPop has
long recommended the use of the anonymous `traversal()` function for this creation.
[source,groovy]
----
// for embedded cases
graph = TinkerGraph.open()
g = traversal().withEmbedded(graph)
// for remote cases
g = traversal().withRemote(DriverRemoteConnection.using(...)))
----
As of this release, those two methods have been deprecated in favor of just `with()` which means you could simply write:
[source,groovy]
----
// for embedded cases
graph = TinkerGraph.open()
g = traversal().with(graph)
// for remote cases
g = traversal().with(DriverRemoteConnection.using(...)))
----
That's a bit less to type, but also removes need to programmatically decide which function to call which hopefully
strengthens the abstraction further. To demonstrate this further consider this next example:
[source,groovy]
----
g = traversal().with("config.properties")
----
The properties file in the above example can either point to a remote configuration or a embedded configuration allowing
"g" to be switched as needed without code changes.

==== Splitting a string into characters using split()
The `split()` step will now split a string into a list of its characters if the given separator is an empty string.
[source,groovy]
----
// previous implementation
g.inject("Hello").split("")
==>[Hello]
// new implementation
g.inject("Hello").split("")
==>[H,e,l,l,o]
----
See: link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-3083[TINKERPOP-3083]
==== Changes to deserialization for gremlin-javascript

Starting from this version, `gremlin-javascript` will deserialize `Set` data into a ECMAScript 2015 Set. Previously,
these were deserialized into arrays.

==== Gremlin Grammar Changes

A number of changes have been introduce to the Gremlin grammar to help make it be more consistent and easier to use.

*`new` keyword is now optional*

The `new` keyword is now optional in all cases where it was previously used. Both of the following examples are now
valid syntax with the second being the preferred form going forward:

[source,groovy]
----
g.V().withStrategies(new SubgraphStrategy(vertices: __.hasLabel('person')))

g.V().withStrategies(SubgraphStrategy(vertices: __.hasLabel('person')))
----

In a future version, it is likely that the `new` keyword will be removed entirely from the grammar.

*Supports withoutStrategies()*

The `withoutStrategies()` configuration step is now supported syntax for the grammar. While this option is not commonly
used it is still a part of the Gremlin language and there are times where it is helpful to have this fine grained
control over how a traversal works.

[source,groovy]
----
g.V().withoutStrategies(CountStrategy)
----

==== Improved handling of integer overflows

Integer overflows caused by addition and multiplication operations will throw an exception instead of being silently
skipped with incorrect result.

=== Upgrading for Providers

==== Graph System Providers

==== Graph Driver Providers
